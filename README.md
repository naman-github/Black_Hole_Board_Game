# My_Board_Game
This is my Project on creation of digital board game and it is part of my assignment.

## Black Hole
**Black Hole** is the simple board game on digital platform. So basically, this game is based on simple tile and can be played on the grid i.e., 4Ã—4. So, we are having 16 tiles to play on. The black holes will be randomly placed on that board. Once a player reaches to that black hole the player has to restart from the start point. Until and unless he reaches the end point this will be repeated. As soon as the player reaches to the end point it will win.

## Game Rules
1.	This game will be started from the first tile in the grid i.e., start point.
2.	There will be a button by which the random will generate between 1 to 4.
3.	The value of the number which has been generated, the same value player will be move forward.
4.	It will move as per the directions in the diagram above.
5.	If the player the player gets on the black hole coordinate, he will lose and the game will be restarted.
6.	If the player successfully reached to the end point without getting caught in the black hole, he will win.
